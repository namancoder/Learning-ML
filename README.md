## Probability_and_Statistics
Learnt so many mathematical theorems and distributions like Gaussian,Uniform,Bernoulli,Binomial,Log Normal,Pareta.

Central Limit theorem,Confidence Interval,  Power Law, Q-Q Plots,Chebyshevs Inequality, Hypothesis Testing , KS-Test,,Resampling & Permutation Test.

## Visualization_and_Dimensionality_Reduction
Handled the 784 dimension MNIST dataset(felt pretty cool actually😍)\


Also learnt about Data Preprocessing which is a must porcess before data analysis
Columnn Normalization and Standardization\

also worked on FASHION MNIST dataset which is the "Hello world" of modern ML ---> [LINK](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FNRGJur7gtauKyt4tY-JrD26Vaso4i0a?usp=sharing)

PCA and t-SNE for Dimensionality Reduction

## NLP_AND_ML
Currently learning about classification and regreesion algo KNN
[TF-IDF Implementation withot SkLearn](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12Kf8PEo2QxH7rOLo79mKaiMt9US6iugJ?usp=sharing)

### KNN
Cosine Similarity & Distance ,Types of distances, Effectiveness, Over & Under-Fitting , Simple & K-Fold Cross Validation , Timebase splitting ,Weighted KNN , KD-Tree , Locality Sensitive Hashing for Cosine Similarity and Euclidean Distance.

------------------
## DEEP_LEARNING
 - Playing with MNIST Data Set using Sequential Model and Adam optimizer, also used CallBacks [Link]()
 - Using Convolutions in our DNN to better the accuracy (2 Conv2d layers and MaxPooling) 
 - Real World images classfication (happy or Sad dataset -40 Happy & 40 Sad) preprocessing with ImageDataGenerator where target_size = (150,150
